i. Write a trigger before inserting the teacher record into a teacher
table. Experience should be a minimum of 4 years. If it is less than 4
years trigger gets fired and displays an appropriate message.

create or replace function b() returns trigger as $$
 begin
   if new.experience<=4 then
     raise exception'Experience should greater than 4';
   end if ;
  end; $$ language plpgsql;
 
create trigger w before insert on teacher for each row execute procedure b();

insert into teacher (experience) values(2);

ii. Write a cursor to accept the student name from the user as an input
and give list of subjects taken by the student.

create or replace function q(name student.sname%type)returns void as $$
 declare
  sub text;
    c1 cursor for select subject from st,student as s where s.Roll_No=st.Roll_no and sname=name;
begin
 open c1;
  loop
    fetch c1 into sub;
    exit when not found;
    raise notice'Subject=%',sub;
    end loop;
 close c1;
 end; $$ language plpgsql;
 select q('sham'); 

iii. Write a stored function to find the details of the maximum
experienced teacher.

create or replace function z()returns void as $$
 declare
  r1 teacher%rowtype;
  begin
   select * into r1 from teacher where experience=(select max(experience)from teacher);
   raise notice'No=% Tname=% Experience=%',r1.tno,r1.tname,r1.experience;
  end; $$ language plpgsql;
 select z();
